<objective>
Move .well-known directory from project root to public/ for Astro static file serving.

Purpose: Astro serves static files from public/ directory. The .well-known files contain iOS and Android deep linking configuration critical for mobile app functionality. Moving these BEFORE any Astro changes prevents accidental loss during migration.

Output: .well-known files relocated to public/.well-known/ where Astro will automatically include them in build output.

  <name>Task 1: Move .well-known directory to public/</name>
  <files>public/.well-known/assetlinks.json, public/.well-known/apple-app-site-association</files>
  <action>
Move the .well-known directory from project root to public/ directory:

1. Verify source files exist at root:
   - .well-known/assetlinks.json (Android deep linking)
   - .well-known/apple-app-site-association (iOS deep linking)

2. Move entire directory:
   ```bash
   mv .well-known public/.well-known
   ```

3. Verify files are in new location:
   - public/.well-known/assetlinks.json
   - public/.well-known/apple-app-site-association

4. Update package.json build script to remove manual copy:
   - Current: "build": "tsc -b && vite build && cp -r .well-known dist/"
   - Updated: "build": "tsc -b && vite build"
   - Reason: Astro will copy public/ contents automatically, and current Vite build still works because public/ is also Vite's static directory

Note: Do NOT delete the original files without confirming the move succeeded.
  </action>
  <verify>
Run: `ls -la public/.well-known/` - should show both files
Run: `ls .well-known 2>/dev/null || echo "Source removed"` - should show "Source removed"
  </verify>
  <done>
- public/.well-known/assetlinks.json exists with same content as original
- public/.well-known/apple-app-site-association exists with same content as original
- Original .well-known directory no longer exists at project root
- package.json build script no longer includes manual cp command
  </done>
</task>

</tasks>

<verification>
1. Files exist in new location: `ls public/.well-known/`
2. Original location cleared: `.well-known/` directory removed from root
3. Build script updated: `grep "cp -r .well-known" package.json` returns nothing
4. Content preserved: File contents unchanged (verify with `cat public/.well-known/assetlinks.json`)
</verification>

<success_criteria>
- .well-known files relocated to public/.well-known/
- Original .well-known directory removed from project root
- package.json build script updated (manual copy removed)
- Files ready for Astro static serving
</success_criteria>

<output>
After completion, create `.planning/phases/01-foundation-setup/01-01-SUMMARY.md`
</output>
