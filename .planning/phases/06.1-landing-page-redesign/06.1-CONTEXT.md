# Phase 6.1: Landing Page Redesign - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-01-31
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Transform the primitive landing page into a conversion-optimized, visually compelling experience. This phase covers visual identity, hero section, feature presentation, social proof, and footer expansion. New capabilities (booking, search, user accounts) are out of scope.

## Implementation Decisions

### Hero Visual Treatment
- **Primary visual:** Parallax travel photography (not app mockups)
- **Photo style:** Mix of groups AND destinations — "friends in beautiful places" emphasizes both togetherness and aspiration
- **Parallax behavior:** Layered depth — multiple image layers moving at different speeds for dramatic, immersive effect
- **Text placement:** Bottom reveal — imagery dominates viewport, headline and CTA appear as user scrolls (cinematic approach)

### Claude's Discretion
- Brand identity (accent color, typography system, warmth level)
- Feature section layout and presentation approach
- Social proof strategy and placement
- Footer structure and content
- Specific image selection and layer composition
- Animation timing and easing curves
- Mobile adaptation of parallax effect
- Fallback for reduced-motion preference

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Parallax should feel "dramatic and immersive" — user explicitly chose this over subtle or interactive carousel
- "Bottom reveal" pattern suggests a scroll-triggered experience where the hero imagery has full impact before asking for action
- Groups in beautiful places — the photos should show BOTH the people AND the destination, not one or the other
