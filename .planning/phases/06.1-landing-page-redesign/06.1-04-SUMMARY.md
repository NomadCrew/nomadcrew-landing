decisions:

    choice: Static "500+ travelers" messaging instead of API-fetched count
    rationale: Simpler, verifiable, no API dependency; can upgrade later if needed
  - id: social-icons-deprecated
    choice: Use deprecated Twitter/Instagram/Facebook/Linkedin icons from lucide-react
    rationale: Icons still functional; newer replacements (X icon) not widely recognized
  - id: four-column-footer
    choice: 4-column responsive grid with brand, product, company, resources sections
    rationale: Industry standard footer layout with room for future expansion

# Phase 6.1 Plan 04: Social Proof & Footer Components Summary

**One-liner:** Static social proof with "500+ travelers" messaging and multi-column responsive footer with social media links.

## What Was Built

### SocialProof Component (`src/components/react/SocialProof.tsx`)
- Static social proof messaging: "Join 500+ travelers on the waitlist"
- Trust badges: Early access, No credit card required, Free forever plan
- Framer Motion entrance animation with whileInView trigger
- Warm minimalist design using design tokens (coral accent, warm backgrounds)
- Self-contained component with no API dependencies or required props

### ExpandedFooter Component (`src/components/react/ExpandedFooter.tsx`)
- Four-column responsive grid layout:
  - Desktop: 4 columns
  - Tablet: 2 columns
  - Mobile: 1 column (stacked)
- Brand column: NomadCrew wordmark + "Group travel, simplified" tagline
- Product links: Features (#features), Join Waitlist (#waitlist)
- Company links: Privacy Policy (/privacy)
- Resources section: "Blog coming soon" placeholder
- Social media icons: Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, LinkedIn
  - All icons have aria-labels for accessibility
  - Hover states with accent color transition
  - External links with target="_blank" and rel="noopener noreferrer"
- Copyright 2026 with border separator

### Test Page (`src/pages/test-social-footer.astro`)
- Isolated verification page at /test-social-footer
- SocialProof with client:visible (below fold optimization)
- ExpandedFooter with client:idle (low priority hydration)
- Manual verification checklist overlay

## Commits

| Task | Commit | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | 4ddd159 | Create SocialProof component with static fallback |
| 2 | ff5dcb9 | Create ExpandedFooter component with navigation and social links |
| 3 | e331a06 | Create test page for SocialProof and ExpandedFooter |

## Verification Results

- [x] `src/components/react/SocialProof.tsx` exists and exports default
- [x] `src/components/react/ExpandedFooter.tsx` exists and exports default (178 lines)
- [x] `src/pages/test-social-footer.astro` exists
- [x] `pnpm run check` passes (0 errors)
- [x] `pnpm run build` succeeds (12 pages built)
- [x] SocialProof displays "Join 500+ travelers on the waitlist"
- [x] ExpandedFooter has brand, product links, company links, social icons
- [x] Footer copyright shows 2026
- [x] Social icons imported from lucide-react (Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, Linkedin)
- [x] Semantic footer element used
- [x] Responsive grid classes present (grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4)

## Success Criteria Met

1. **UI-03:** SocialProof displays static waitlist count with trust indicator messaging
2. **UI-04:** ExpandedFooter includes product links, company links, and social media icons
3. Footer is responsive (4 cols desktop, 2 tablet, 1 mobile)
4. All interactive elements have hover/focus states (transition-colors)
5. Social icons have aria-labels for accessibility
6. Test page allows verification of both components at /test-social-footer

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Technical Notes

- ExpandedFooter exceeds min_lines requirement (178 lines vs 50 minimum)
- TypeScript deprecation warnings for social icons are cosmetic only; icons function correctly
- Component bundle sizes (from build output):
  - SocialProof: 2.53 KB (0.99 KB gzipped)
  - ExpandedFooter: 5.45 KB (1.56 KB gzipped)

## Next Phase Readiness

**Ready for:** Plan 06.1-05 (Final Integration)
- SocialProof and ExpandedFooter ready for landing page integration
- Both components use design tokens for consistent styling
- Hydration strategies defined (client:visible and client:idle)
