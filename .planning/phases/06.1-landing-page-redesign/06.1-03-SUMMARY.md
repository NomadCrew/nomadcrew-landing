## Performance

- **Duration:** 4 min

- **Tasks:** 2
- **Files created:** 2

## Accomplishments
- BentoFeatures component with variable card sizes (large, wide, small)
- Responsive CSS Grid layout: 1 column mobile, 2 tablet, 4 desktop

- Test page for isolated component verification

## Task Commits

Each task was committed atomically:

1. **Task 1: Create BentoFeatures component** - `7f62325` (feat)
2. **Task 2: Create test page for bento grid verification** - `096e678` (feat)

## Files Created/Modified
- `src/components/react/BentoFeatures.tsx` - Bento grid feature showcase with 4 features (147 lines)
- `src/pages/test-bento.astro` - Test page with viewport indicator and verification checklist

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Context | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|---------|--------|-----------|
| Large card for Trip Planning | Visual hierarchy in bento grid | 2 cols x 2 rows span | Primary feature gets prominent placement |
| Dense grid auto-flow | Bento layout gap handling | gridAutoFlow: 'dense' | Eliminates whitespace gaps between variable-sized cards |
| Icon background pill | Visual design consistency | Colored background with opacity | Creates visual hierarchy, aligns with warm minimalist aesthetic |
| Design token usage | Styling consistency | CSS custom properties | Maintains design system consistency established in 06.1-01 |

## Deviations from Plan

None - plan executed exactly as written.

## Issues Encountered

None - both tasks completed without issues.

## User Setup Required

None - no external service configuration required.

## Verification Results

| Criteria | Status |
|----------|--------|
| BentoFeatures.tsx exists and exports default | PASS |
| test-bento.astro exists | PASS |
| pnpm run check passes | PASS (0 errors) |
| pnpm run build succeeds | PASS |
| Component uses CSS Grid classes | PASS (grid-cols, col-span, row-span) |
| All 4 features represented | PASS |
| Responsive classes present | PASS (md:, lg: prefixes) |
| min_lines requirement (60) | PASS (147 lines) |

## Next Phase Readiness

**Ready for 06.1-04:** Features section integration
- BentoFeatures component ready to replace current FeatureCard grid
- Uses design tokens from 06.1-01 for consistent styling
- Test page at /test-bento for verification

**No blockers**
