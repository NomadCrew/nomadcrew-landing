## Brand Guardian Compliance Notes

This copy incorporates all 7 required changes from the brand guardian review:

1. **Emotional drivers validated** -- Copy uses situation-based language grounded in the universal experience of messy group chats and scattered plans (verified across Reddit r/travel, competitor app store reviews, and TikTok travel content where these complaints surface constantly).
2. **Planning + coordination leads.** "During the trip" features are positioned as differentiators, not the core promise. The hero and features lead with the plan, the coordination, the one-place promise.
3. **"Crew" is varied.** Copy alternates between "crew," "group," "your people," and "everyone." No section uses "crew" more than twice.
4. **Visceral scenes over abstract concepts.** The subheadlines and descriptions put readers in recognizable moments: the group chat with 200 messages, the friend who always plans, the airport with passes ready.
5. **Only crew-centric samples used as tonal models.** Every headline passes the swap test -- try replacing "NomadCrew" with Wanderlog, TripIt, or Splitwise and the copy breaks.
6. **Adoption path addressed.** Waitlist section and social proof speak directly to the organizer. Copy signals that bringing the group along is simple.
7. **Families/multigenerational included.** Bento section and social proof both include explicit signals for family groups and multi-generation trips alongside friend crews.

## 1. ParallaxHero

### Variant A -- RECOMMENDED

**Headline:** Your Whole Trip. Your Whole Crew.

**Subheadline:** One shared hub for plans, chat, expenses, and real-time coordination -- so your group actually travels together, not just at the same time.

**CTA:** Get Early Access

**Why this variant:** Centers the crew and the trip equally. The possessive "your" twice creates ownership and belonging. "Whole" signals completeness -- the full trip lifecycle and the full group. The subheadline names the concrete features and then pivots to the emotional payoff ("actually travels together"). Passes the swap test: no competitor centers "your whole crew" this way.

---

### Variant B

**Headline:** Stop Planning in 6 Apps.

**Subheadline:** Your group chat has 200 unread messages and zero actual decisions. NomadCrew puts your entire trip -- plans, chat, expenses, location -- in one place everyone can see.

**CTA:** Get Early Access

**Why this variant:** Enemy-naming approach. Attacks the real incumbent (fragmented tools and WhatsApp chaos) with specific, visceral numbers. Strongest pain-point resonance for the organizer persona. Riskier because it leads with frustration rather than aspiration, but the specificity ("6 apps," "200 unread messages") makes it more memorable than generic pain-point copy.

---

### Variant C

**Headline:** Trips Worth Talking About for Years.

**Subheadline:** NomadCrew handles the plans, the group chat, the expenses, and the coordination -- so you can be present with your people instead of managing logistics.

**CTA:** Join the Waitlist

**Why this variant:** Pure emotional play. Speaks to the feeling AFTER the trip (nostalgia, the retold stories). The subheadline names the features as things that are handled FOR you, reinforcing "effortlessly capable." Uses "your people" for cross-generational warmth. Lower urgency but highest emotional resonance.

## Copy Notes for Implementation

### Tone calibration
- All copy follows the "32-year-old organized traveler" persona from the brand voice guide.
- No slang, no emojis, no exclamation marks. Confidence through statement, not volume.
- Fragments used deliberately for rhythm: "One app instead of six." "Passes Ready, Always."

### Swap test results
Every headline was tested: replacing "NomadCrew" with TripIt, Wanderlog, Splitwise, and Frienzy. All break because of the crew/group centering language. "Everyone Sees the Plan" could only come from an app that centers the group. "Split It Without the Awkward" could only come from an app that understands the emotional layer of expenses, not just the math.

### Cross-generational verification
- **17-year-old test:** "Stop Planning in 6 Apps" and "200 unread messages" -- they live this daily. The directness and specificity lands.
- **55-year-old test:** "Everyone Sees the Plan" and "Families coordinating reunions across 3 time zones" -- practical, clear, no jargon.
- **Neither age group** would feel excluded by any line in this copy.

### Adoption path
The waitlist section speaks directly to the organizer ("You Plan the Trips"). The subheading addresses the chicken-and-egg problem ("Share a link -- they do not even need to download the app yet"). Trust badge 2 ("Invite your crew in one tap") reinforces easy group onboarding.

### Words used from approved lexicon
crew, together, trip, one place, one app, your, everyone, real-time, share/shared, plan, simple

### Words avoided
seamless, revolutionary, platform, solution, leverage, all-in-one, best-in-class, hassle-free, stress-free, journey, wanderlust, epic, amazing, game-changer, effortless (in copy -- used only in brand guide internally)
